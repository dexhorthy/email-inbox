Mark as spam all emails that:
- are a cold outreach email
- are a sales/marketing email e.g. for an e-commerce site, unless they focus primarily on sharing community content or trending topics like memes, and do not push direct sales aggressively. 

do NOT mark as spam emails that:
- pertain to event notifications, unless they are error alerts or system-generated error messages from automated services; mark error alerts and system-generated error messages from automated services as spam, except those from trusted monitoring services like Sentry
- contain an authentication/authorization code e.g. for 2FA
- contain a "magic link" to sign in or similar.
