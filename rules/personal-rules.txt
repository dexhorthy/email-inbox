Mark as spam all emails that:
- are from marketing lists or newsletters I didn't explicitly subscribe to
- are cold sales/recruitment emails 
- have excessive promotional language like "amazing deal", "limited time"
- are from crypto/NFT/investment schemes

do NOT mark as spam emails that:
- are from GitHub, Gmail, or other services I use
- contain authentication codes or security alerts
- are from friends, family, or work colleagues
- are from Y Combinator, Bookface, or startup-related content I'm interested in
